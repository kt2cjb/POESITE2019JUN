== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I share my post to Instagram without featured image? =

No. Your post/product must have a featured image to share on Instagram. Without featured image, no post/product will be shared.

= Can I add a custom message to my post/product for sharing? =

Yes. You can add a custom message before publishing post/product. Click on edit link in publish area of the post.

= Can I add #hashtags before posting to Instagram? =

Yes. You can add #hashtags in custom message before publishing post/product.

= What if I don't want to share a post/product? =

If you uncheck the box 'Post to Instagram?' in publish area, it will not be shared.

= I am receiving the error "checkpoint_required"? =

It means that Instagram wants you to prove that you are human and that you are the owner of the account. Because you are login from your webserver. To resolve this, simply login to your account via the official website or your mobile device - that should fix it. If you still get the error again, it means Instagram dislikes your server's IP and that you must login to your account via Instagram's website and your server's IP to prove to them that your server's IP is a human.

= I am receiving the error "Couldn't get challenge, check your connection"? =

You need to login to your account via Instagram's website to verfity your account.
